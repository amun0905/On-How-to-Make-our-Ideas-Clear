This repository contains Amun Govil Lie's undergraduate essay for the module Topics in Non-Analytic Philosophy at King's College London.

It examines Charles Sanders Peirce's seminal text "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" and the philosophical tradition of pragmatism. 

Mark: 62

Feedback: This is a clearly-written essay which shows a good understanding of Peirce's position in "How to Make Our Ideas Clear". The author presents a clear survey of Peirce's paper and engages with its criticisms of Descartes and Leibniz. The essay is somewhat derivative however - focussing mainly on providing a description of Peirce's position rather than
subjecting it to critical evaluation - and could benefit from being more clearly structured around a thesis explicitly stated in the introduction. The essay might also be improved by greater engagement with relevant secondary literature.
