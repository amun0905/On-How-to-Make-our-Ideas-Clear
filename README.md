This repository contains Amun Govil Lie's undergraduate essay for the module Topics in Non-Analytic Philosophy at King's College London.

It examines Charles Sanders Peirce's seminal text "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" and the philosophical tradition of pragmatism. 

Feedback received: This is a clearly-written essay which shows a good understanding of Peirce's position in "How to Make Our Ideas Clear". However, it could be improved by greater engagement with secondary literature and more critical evaluation of Pierce's position.
